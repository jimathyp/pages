# tech-pages

A collection of useful or not so useful pages on any technical related topic.

### Usage

The in-browser file editor on GitHub can be used to maintain and preview the content in Markdown files for the website.

When commits are made to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in the site, from the content in the Markdown files.

Uses the Jekyll theme "Slate". The theme is specified in the `_config.yml` file.
