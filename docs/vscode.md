# VSCode


Can be opened from the command line:

`
code
`

Can also list extensions, install extensions.


## Extensions

When installing, ther terminal path was in WSL, but it was trying to run the Windows Python binary.

Opened VSCode Remote WSL then tried again - works this time.




## Jupyter

It is possible to run notebooks directly in VScode.

Will need to determine how to do this from a vanilla new install.
